##Compiled vs Intepreted Language
JavaScript is a compiled language. An intepreted language is run line-by-line: the intepreter has no idea what to expect from the line that follows the currently intrepreted line. In a compiled languages, a compiler runs through code once to compile it initially, makes one more run-through, and then on the final pass it will execute the code.
